# Package structure
The main package folders are backend and frontend.

Every folder has lesson packages with the number given in text format, e.g. lesson_one, lesson_two.

Every lesson has one or more packages.


If a package in backend folder does not have a main.py module, then it is not a part of homework.

Instead, it is an import module for homework packages.


If a folder exists in frontend folder, then it is an site or any related to it. To start it run any file with .html extension.

# How to run
To run homework just run main.py module from the specified module.
