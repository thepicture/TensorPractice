# Package structure
The main repo's folders are the backend and the frontend.

Every folder has lessons folders, e.g. lesson_one, lesson_two.

Every lesson folder has one or more packages or site pages inside it.


If a package in backend folder does not have a main.py module, then it is not a part of a homework.

Instead, it is an import module for programs written in python.


If a folder exists in the frontend folder, then it is a site or any files related to it. To start it, run any file with .html extension.

# How to run
To run homework just run main.py module from the specified module.
